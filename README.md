# Introduction

This project is an implementation of a TOML parser in C for learning purposes.  
Moreover, I try to follow Epitech C Coding Style.

# Limitations

For now, this parser won't be able to parse neither UTF-8 encoded string nor date and time.

# Implementation Step

- [x] Type
- [x] Variant
- [x] Array
